                    BloxTeams is not my personal project but rather a team project of which I am a co-founder and it is
                    developed at <a href="https://bloxteams.com">bloxteams.com</a>.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Developing BloxTeams taught and still teaches me a lot; it helped me improve my programming skills, in fact
                    BloxTeams was near release on June/July 2022 but looking at the code I realized it was terribly inefficient
                    and which all the new things and concepts I had learned it could've been improved a lot hence I decided to
                    rewrite the entire back-end.

                    <p>
                        BloxTeams was born from the idea me and Paige had back in 2021 to provide a free and accessible platform
                        to all Roblox developers who were afraid of engaging in commissions due to scammers being always behind
                        the corner. Works started around May 2022 when the first commit was made.
