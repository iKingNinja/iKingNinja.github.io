                Accounts manager is a browser extension that lets you keep multiple accounts connected at the same time and switch
                among them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accounts manager watches for requests made to Roblox's login endpoint and asks you if you want to save the account you
                logged in; when you click yes (ok) the extension will create a copy of the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie of the account you
                saved applying the same security measures of the original cookie to keep the same level of security for the account as
                if you weren't using the extension.
            </p>
